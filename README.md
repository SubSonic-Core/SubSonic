# SubSonic-Core
The driving force behind this project is the various issues with the current EF DAL available for .net core 2.2 during 2019.
various issues in which prevented minimal manipulation of the data to release projects.
This way I know the DAL from the ground up and speak for its performance and implemenation. 

one goal of this project is to minimize the references to 3rd party projects which use namespaces that can come into conflict with the .net core library.
